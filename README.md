# WP-Downloads-Directory #

A custom downloads directory plugin to list downloads available for purchase or download.

~Current Version:1.0~

## Usage ##
To use this plugin, simply download and install it as usual.

By default, new downloads have its info page at downloads/post-slug.

To create an archive page, just add the shortcode [wpddir_downloads_list] to any page, perhaps one called "Downloads" for good user experience.

To customize the single page for each download, please create a template called single-wpddir_downloads.php in your theme.
